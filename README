CenterIM 5 is a text-mode IM client for Linux, *BSD, Solaris and other Unices
that uses libpurple as a communication backend.

Personal customizations:

* Always display buddy name in messages (use alias, if available).
* Don't overzealously strip newlines.
* Don't display status indicators in buddy list, rely on color instead.
* Change date format to "%d %b %Y %H:%M".

I realize it would be more reasonable to apply these changes via plugins or
some other type of preference method and contribute them to the original repo.
But, I am not a C++ developer and these changes are admittedly wanton, made by
trial and error without any regard to correctness (other than appearing to
work properly). It's simply my personal playground.
